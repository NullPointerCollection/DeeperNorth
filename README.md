# DeeperNorth

## Description
A simple mod to replace Mountain biomes in Deep North with more Deep North. This is only useful if you have mods that add locations, vegetation, mobs, etc. to Deep North.
If you use any mods that modify maps or terrain, I highly recommend testing this out for compatibility issues.

## Installation
  BACK UP YOUR EXISTING WORLD BEFORE USING THIS MOD! 
  This mod needs to be installed on the server and client to work properly. Installing on one or the other will result in issues with creature spawning, location and vegetation generation, and possibly other unknown issues.
  
## Usage
There is no config needed, as all the mod does is make all of Deep North the same biome, regardless of elevation.
  
## Adding to existing worlds
If no one has explored Deep North on your world yet, you can use the command "genloc" which regenerates locations in unexplored areas. If you have already explored Deep North, you will need to use UpgradeWorld by JereKuusela to reset the locations in those areas. For vegetation, you need to use UpgradeWorld to reset vegetation if you've already explored Deep North.  Vegetation will generate automatically if you haven't explored DN yet.
